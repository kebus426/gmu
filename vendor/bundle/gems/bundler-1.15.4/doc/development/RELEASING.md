# Releasing

_Release process documentation is in progress, see [PR 5252](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/5252)._

## Beta testing

Early releases require heavy testing, especially across various system setups. We :heart: testers, and are big fans of anyone who can run `gem install bundler --pre` and try out upcoming releases in their development and staging environments.

There may not always be prereleases or beta versions of Bundler. The Bundler team will tweet from the [@bundlerio account](http://twitter.com/bundlerio) when a prerelease or beta version becomes available. You are also always welcome to try checking out master and building a gem yourself if you want to try out the latest changes.
